JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables in JavaScript can hold values of different data types. JavaScript has several data types, which can be broadly categorized into two categories: primitive data types and reference data types.

Primitive Data Types:

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. For example: let num = 42;
String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. For example: let str = "Hello, World!";
Boolean: Represents a true or false value. For example: let isTrue = true;
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. For example: let x;
Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value. For example: let y = null;
Symbol (ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value used as object property keys. For example: const sym = Symbol("description");
BigInt (ES11): Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number data type. For example: const bigNum = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
Reference Data Types:

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs and is used to store complex data structures. For example:
javascript
Copy code
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
Array: A special type of object that holds an ordered collection of values. For example: let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Function: A type that represents executable code. Functions are also objects in JavaScript. For example:
javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it; the interpreter determines the data type at runtime based on the assigned value. This flexibility makes JavaScript a versatile language, but it also requires careful handling of data types to prevent unexpected behavior.
